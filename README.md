# Semantic search
Implement Semantic search with mongoDB

## Usage:
1. create ```APIkey.txt``` and put your openai APIkey inside it
2. run ```python -u main.py```

## NOTE:
- function ```embeddingData(field:str)``` should only be run once if no change is made to the field being embeded (inorder to save openai API's tokens)
